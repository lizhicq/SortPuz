1. Preprocessing
You'll need to convert the data into a format suitable for training. This might include:

Resizing the images to a consistent shape.
Encoding the color labels into numerical values.
Creating appropriate labels for multi-label classification.

2. Model Architecture
You can build a CNN as mentioned earlier, but you may also consider using architectures that are suitable for multi-label classification.

3. Training and Evaluation
Train and evaluate the model as described earlier.

4. Post-Processing
You may need to translate the model's numerical predictions back into color labels for interpretation.

Would you like me to help you with any specific part of this process, such as writing the preprocessing code or building the model architecture tailored to this data?
